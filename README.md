### Here‚Äôs a Local Setup Guide for your Planzit GitHub repository in:

# Planzit ‚Äì Local Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up the Planzit project locally.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v18.x or higher)  
- **npm** or **yarn** (for package management)  
- **Git**  
- **PostgreSQL** (if required for database setup)  
- **Nylas Developer Account** (for Nylas API integration)

## 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:
`git clone https://github.com/arushsingh03/planzit.git
cd planzit`
## 2. Install Dependencies
#### Using npm
`npm install`

#### Or using yarn
`yarn install`

## 3. Create a .env File

| **Environment Variable**      | **Description**                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `AUTH_SECRET`                 | Secret key used to sign and verify authentication tokens.      |
| `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` / `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth credentials for enabling GitHub login.   |
| `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` / `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` | Google OAuth credentials for Google login integration. |
| `DATABASE_URL`                | Connection string for accessing the primary database.          |
| `DIRECT_URL`                  | Direct access URL for specific database operations or APIs.    |
| `NYLAS_API_SECRET_KEY` / `NYLAS_API_URI` / `NYLAS_CLIENT_ID` | Nylas API credentials for email, calendar, or communication sync. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL`             | Public URL for the app, used for client-side requests.          |
| `UPLOADTHING_TOKEN`           | Token for managing file uploads through UploadThing service.   |

## 4. Run the Database (Optional)
If you are using PostgreSQL, make sure the database is running. You can set up the schema by running:
`npx prisma migrate dev`

## 5. Start the Development Server
Run the following command to start the development server:

####  Using npm
`npm run dev`

#### Or using yarn
`yarn dev`

## The application will be available at:
`http://localhost:3000`

## 6. Verify OAuth Setup
Ensure that your GitHub and Google OAuth integrations are correctly configured by testing the login flows. You may need to whitelist http://localhost:3000 in the OAuth provider's settings.

## 7. Sync with Nylas API (Optional)
Make sure you have set up your Nylas credentials and configured the API access properly. Verify that the Nylas sync works for scheduling features.

# Linting and Formatting (Optional)
Run the following commands to ensure code quality:

## 8. Lint the code
`npm run lint`

## 9.  Format the code
`npm run format`
## 10. Build the Application (Optional)
To create a production build:

`npm run build`

## 11. Contributing (Optional)
If you plan to contribute, create a new branch:

git checkout -b your-feature-branch
After making changes, push your branch and open a pull request.

## Troubleshooting
Port Conflict: If 3000 is in use, update NEXT_PUBLIC_URL in the .env and run the server on a different port:
`PORT=4000/5000 npm run dev`
Database Issues: Make sure your DATABASE_URL is correct and PostgreSQL is running.
